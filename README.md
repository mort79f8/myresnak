A remake of an old program that i used when i was in high school back in the 80's

the idea is to make a page where you can type in commands, add them to a list and then run a script that will draw
based on the commands given.

## basic commands:
forward(#) - moves the ant # , # being an integer.
back(#) - move the ant back #.
turnleft(#) - turns the ant to the left # degrees.
turnright(#) - turn the ant to the right # degrees.

## more advances commands:
color('') - selects the color of the line.
lift - lifts the "pen" so there will not be drawned a line if the ant move.
place - puts the "pen" on the canvas, so a line will now be drawned when the ant move.
repeat(#) - start a loop of commands. # being number of times to repeat the loop
end - command to show where the loop commands ends.
